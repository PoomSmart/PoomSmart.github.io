            <li>
                <p>This tweak was fully tested on iPhone 4s iOS 9.0.2/9.3.5. Other devices might support, but is not guaranteed.</p> <p>This tweak allows you to use Dictation to say words like "Capture", "Cheese" in order to take photos. You can personalize words from settings too. One downside of this tweak is that it will not work with devices with camera using multiple inputs at a time. For instance, iPhone that is compatible with Live Photo will not support. It was supposed to be the first commercial tweak but the developer itself did basically give up developing and just opened source this tweak. Perhaps some talented guys out there would refine it to be something special.</p>
